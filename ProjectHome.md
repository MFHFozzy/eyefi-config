This is an open implementation of some of the tools needed to manage an [Eye-Fi card](http://www.eye.fi).

Note that this does not replace the Eye-Fi-supplied tool for card registration or changing online upload services, nor does it perform as the "Upload to my computer" destination.

It does allow you to
  * Scan for wireless networks
  * Add, remove and test wireless networks (WPA-PSK and unsecured for now)
  * Reboot the card
  * List configured networks on the card
  * Fetch the card's unique key and MAC address

Credit goes to Chris Davies for his initial implementation and expert guidance.  We can also not forget the Eye-Fi team for producing such a neat product and creating an environment for others to work with it.
